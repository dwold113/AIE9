# Build 🏗️

In today's assignment, we'll be creating Fireworks AI endpoints, and then building a RAG application.

- 🤝 Breakout Room #1
  - Set-up Open Source Endpoint (Instructions [here](./ENDPOINT_SETUP.md)) ((This process may take 15-20min.))
  - Test Endpoint and Embeddings with the `endpoint_slammer.ipynb` notebook.
- 🤝 Breakout Room #2
  - Use the Open Source Endpoints to build a RAG LangGraph application

# Ship 🚢

The completed notebook and your RAG app/notebook!

### Deliverables

- A short Loom of either:
  - the notebook and the RAG application you built for the Main Homework Assignment; or
  - the notebook you created for the Advanced Build

# Share 🚀

Make a social media post about your final application!

### Deliverables

- Make a post on any social media platform about what you built!

Here's a template to get you started:

```
🚀 Exciting News! 🚀

I am thrilled to announce that I have just built and shipped a RAG application powered by open-source endpoints! 🎉🤖

# Submitting You Homework [OPTIONAL]

## Main Homework Assignment

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework assignment:

1. Follow the instructions in `ENDPOINT_SETUP.md`
2. Replace both `model` values in `endpoint_slammer.ipynb` with the `gpt-oss` endpoint you created in Step 1
3. Run the code cells in `endpoint_slammer.ipynb`
4. Respond to the questions in the section below
5. Build a sample RAG
6. Record a Loom video reviewing what you have learned from this session

## Questions

### ❓ Question #1:

What is the difference between serverless and dedicated endpoints?

#### ✅ Answer:

Serverless endpoints are great for spinning up quick prototypes, and require no setup or deployment. You can use them immediately and its shared accross varous clients meaning latency and availability can very with load. For Dedicated endpoints you own and deploy the endpoint, its not shared but you are responsible for cost while its running. Its great for production and when you need consistent performance and more control over scaling

### ❓ Question #2:

Why is it important to consider token throughput and latency when choosing an LLM for user-facing applications?

#### ✅ Answer:

For user-facing applications, token throughput and latency directly affect whether the app feels fast and reliable. Choosing an LLM  with suitable latency and throughput helps keep users engaged and supports growth without degrading experience under load.

## Activity 1: RAGAS Evaluation with Cost Analysis

Use RAGAS to evaluate your open-source Fireworks AI powered RAG app against an OpenAI `gpt-4.1-mini` powered equivalent. Compare retrieval quality, answer faithfulness, and end-to-end accuracy across both providers.

Additionally, instrument both pipelines with **LangSmith** to capture token usage and cost per query. Use LangSmith's tracing and cost dashboards to compare the total cost of running each provider at scale. Include your evaluation results, cost breakdown, and analysis in your Loom video.

## Advanced Activity: Local Models

Swap out the Fireworks AI endpoints for **locally-running open-source models** using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) or another local inference server of your choice. Run both your embedding model and your chat model locally, and rebuild the RAG pipeline on top of them.

- Compare quality and latency between the local setup and your Fireworks AI hosted endpoint.
- Reflect: what are the trade-offs of local models vs. managed endpoints in a production setting?

Include your findings and a demo in your Loom video.
